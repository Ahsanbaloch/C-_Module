# 42 CPP Modules (CPP00-CPP09)

## Project Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ modules (CPP00 to CPP09) from the 42 school curriculum. These modules are designed to introduce and deepen understanding of C++ programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced features.

## Modules

### [CPP00](./CPP00) - Basics
- Introduction to C++
- Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const

### [CPP01](./CPP01) - Memory Allocation, References
- New and delete
- References vs. pointers
- Switch statement

### [CPP02](./CPP02) - Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical class form

### [CPP03](./CPP03) - Inheritance
- Inheritance
- Access specifiers

### [CPP04](./CPP04) - Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces

### [CPP05](./CPP05) - Exceptions
- Try/Catch
- Exceptions

### [CPP06](./CPP06) - Casts
- Different types of casts

### [CPP07](./CPP07) - Templates
- Function templates
- Class templates

### [CPP08](./CPP08) - Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms
- STL containers
- Iterators
- Algorithms

### [CPP09](./CPP09) - STL
- More advanced use of STL

## Skills Developed

- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Memory management
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
- Exception handling
- Template programming

## Usage

Each module contains multiple exercises. To compile and run:

1. Navigate to the specific exercise directory
2. Run `make` to compile
3. Execute the resulting program

## Note

These projects are part of the 42 school curriculum. The code adheres to the school's coding standards and project requirements.
